# FileTemperingChecker
In this project tempering of files can be monitored and 2 options are given 

1) To check files in a folder
2) To files in a folders in a directory or folder

Depending on what you will choose it will ask you for the path. After giving it the path it will start running and once the file is tempered it will display the message and also maintain logs in a textfile that which file is changed and when it is changed. It works by calculating hashes

Currently it doesn't have any GUI

Filetype tested:
textfiles, imagefiles
